description: A tool for fast automatic 3D-stitching of teravoxel-sized microscopy
  images using cloud computing resources and TeraStitcher. This version works with
  the code ocean pipeline feature since at this moment, it is not possible to include
  parameters in the execution. It generates an XML with the stitching transformations.
